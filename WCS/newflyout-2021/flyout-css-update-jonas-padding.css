/*It is probabily done because the flyouts do not have a fixed height, that gives flexibility what we can but in the flyouts but can cause a mismatch with this list, looks very dirty. 
HOwever we need to fix this, introducing a constraint to the flyouts is OK, visually much more pleasing and easy to make a nice box of the list and flyout.*/
